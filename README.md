# 18.01SC - Single Variable Calculus - MIT OCW

I completed 18.01SC from MIT OpenCourseWare and this repo contains all of my notes from the lectures and chapters I studied in the textbook I used (Edwards and Penney, Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th Ed.), and my solutions to the problems sets and exams.

I wrote a [medium article about how long it took to complete this course](https://goepigen.medium.com/i-self-studied-mitopencourseware-18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-in-192-hours-9dbb205639b1), the tools I used, and other helpful tips.
